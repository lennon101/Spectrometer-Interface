[ReleaseNotes-2.1.2.txt]

Release Date: 2013-01-22 (Version 2.1.2)

This release adds several significant enhancements and fixes, including:

* Added continuous strobe for STS [#2847]
* Added support for Apex and Ventana [#2842] 
* Added seabreeze_get_usb_descriptor_string() to allow access to FX2 
  version [#2806]
* Fixed Feature initializers (restores gain-correction on USB2000+ and
  other spectrometers) [#2835]

Note that the final Ventana firmware was not available at release, so 
SeaBreeze support may require an additional release once that product
is in formal production.

[ReleaseNotes-2.1.1.txt]

Release Date: 2012-12-20 (Version 2.1.1)

This release is hoped to fix a handful of 32-bit vs 64-bit issues which were 
reported to cause issues on some 64-bit customer platforms, yet were never 
fully reproduced by Ocean Optics testing.

* Added seabreeze_set_continuous_strobe_period_microseconds()
* Added seabreeze_write_usb() and seabreeze_read_usb()
* Added seabreeze_write_eeprom_slot()

[SeaBreeze 2.0 Release Notes]

This is a significant release of SeaBreeze in that it merges the Ocean Optics
"core" version of the SeaBreeze driver (used for internal projects) with the
"OEM" version (sometimes called SeaBreezeOEM), which was used for external
customer projects.

By merging the two forks back into a unified whole, this ensures that:

1. External OEM customers will receive the "latest and greatest" updates which
Ocean Optics is regularly adding for its own use; and

2. Ocean Optics will be "eating its own dog food" as it were, continually
testing and utilizing the same software which we provide to our OEM customers.

Both consequences are anticipated to benefit OEM customers over time, by
improving both timeliness and robustness of future releases.

Key changes in SeaBreeze 2.0 for existing internal (non-OEM users) include:

- build process has been streamlined and simplified for POSIX architectures
(Linux and MacOS)

- automated Doxygen documentation has been added (see doc/)

- a working Visual Studio solution has been added (see os-support/windows)

- Windows device drivers have been added to the distribution

- support for easier memory profiling has been added (see
include/common/globals.h)

- support has been added to completely destroy the SeaBreezeWrapper and
DeviceFactory singletons, which had been found to generate spurious memory
warnings under Visual Studio

- a rudimentary library of sample code has been started to demonstrate how to
implement basic spectral processing functions in application code, add timeouts
to potentially blocking seabreeze functions (like getSpectrum), etc (see
sample-code/)

Key changes in SeaBreeze 2.0 for existing OEM users include:

- support for RS-232 and ethernet buses has been added

- support for the Torus has been added

- support for the Jaz has been added

- support for stray light coefficients has been added

- an entirely new SeaBreezeAPI has been added, which will allow support for many
powerful new capabilities in the Jaz, STS, QE65kPro, and other advanced
spectrometers (see include/api/seabreezeapi)

- previously supported spectral processing functions have been removed from the
core driver, including multi-scan averaging, boxcar filters, non-linearity
correction and electrical dark correction.  All functions can still be
implemented in application code, and we are in the process of documentating how
each of these and other functions can be simply achieved (see sample-code/)

Additional changes will be new for all users:

- Linux udev rules have been updated to work on the latest common distributions

- A C# GUI demonstration application has been added under
sample-code/CSharpDemo.  This demonstrates how to perform a number of
commonly-requested basic functions, such as threaded background spectral
acquisition, real-time graphing using .NET 4.0 DataVisualization, absolute
irradiance calculation, how to build Windows installers, etc.

- updated Windows device drivers have been provided for the HR2000+,
Maya2000Pro, NIRQuest256, NIRQuest512, and USB2000+
