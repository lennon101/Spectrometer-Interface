<p>
	We are setting up a sequence of acquisitions with an integration time of 500ms, 10
	scans to average and
	no boxcar smoothing.
</p>
<p>
	There will be 5 spectra with a 5 second interval between acquisitions. The spectra
	will be saved into the directory /home/ocean on the SD card with one spectra per
	file. Each file will begin with the prefix acquire
	followed by the numeric position in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
	We will retrieve the results at a later time using the "Manage Results" page on the
	Raspberry Pi.
</p>
<p>
	Implementation detail: we must use several of our scripts to do all of this. The
	quick way of doing this
	in a single web page is to use iframes. The scripts will run sequentially - we
	don't care what order
	they are executed in, only that they all complete before we start the sequence of
	acquisitions with
	the submit button below.
